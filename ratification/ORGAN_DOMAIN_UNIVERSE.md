## III. Extensible Domain Organs

Systems may introduce additional Organs beyond the Core Canonical Organs.

**Requirements for Extensible Domain Organs:**

- They must represent a coherent business domain
- They must not merge unrelated capabilities
- They must not violate lower-layer invariants
- They must pass structural audit before ratification

**Explicit constraint:**

No arbitrary domain explosion is permitted.

---

## IV. Structural Rules

The following structural rules are locked and immutable:

- Organs cannot overlap in responsibility
- Organs cannot redefine category behavior
- Organs cannot embed UI
- Organs cannot define deployment
- Organs cannot act as Systems

---

## V. Amendment Rule

Modifications to the Organ Domain Universe are governed by the following rules:

- Core Canonical Organs require constitutional amendment to change
- Extensible Organs require formal audit before inclusion
- Merging or splitting requires structural review

---

## VI. Ratification Statement

This document declares:
